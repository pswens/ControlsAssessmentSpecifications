# CIS Control 13: Network Monitoring and Defense

Operate processes and tooling to establish and maintain comprehensive
network monitoring and defense against security threats across the
enterprise's network infrastructure and user base.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

We cannot rely on network defenses to be perfect. Adversaries continue
to evolve and mature, as they share, or sell, information among their
community on exploits and bypasses to security controls. Even if
security tools work "as advertised," it takes an understanding of the
enterprise risk posture to configure, tune, and log them to be
effective. Often, misconfigurations due to human error or lack of
knowledge of tool capabilities give enterprises a false sense of
security.

Security tools can only be effective if they are supporting a process of
continuous monitoring that allows staff the ability to be alerted and
respond to security incidents quickly. Enterprises that adopt a purely
technology-driven approach will also experience more false positives,
due to their over-reliance on alerts from tools. Identifying and
responding to these threats requires visibility into all threat vectors
of the infrastructure and leveraging humans in the process of detection,
analysis, and response. It is critical for large or heavily targeted
enterprises to have a security operations capability to prevent, detect,
and quickly respond to cyber threats before they can impact the
enterprise. This process will generate activity reports and metrics that
will help enhance security policies, and support regulatory compliance
for many enterprises.

As we have seen many times in the press, enterprises have been
compromised for weeks, months, or years before discovery. The primary
benefit of having comprehensive situational awareness is to increase the
speed of detection and response. This is critical to respond quickly
when malware is discovered, credentials are stolen, or when sensitive
data is compromised to reduce impact to the enterprise.

Through good situational awareness (i.e., security operations),
enterprises will identify and catalog Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTPs) of attackers, including their IOCs that will help the
enterprise become more proactive in identifying future threats or
incidents. Recovery can be achieved faster when the response has access
to complete information about the environment and enterprise structure
to develop efficient response strategies.
