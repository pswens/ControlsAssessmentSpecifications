# CIS Control 18: Penetration Testing

Test the effectiveness and resiliency of enterprise assets through
identifying and exploiting weaknesses in controls (people, processes,
and technology), and simulating the objectives and actions of an
attacker.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

A successful defensive posture requires a comprehensive program of
effective policies and governance, strong technical defenses, combined
with appropriate action from people. However, it is rarely perfect. In a
complex environment where technology is constantly evolving and new
attacker tradecraft appears regularly, enterprises should periodically
test their controls to identify gaps and to assess their resiliency.
This test may be from external network, internal network, application,
system, or device perspective. It may include social engineering of
users, or physical access control bypasses.

Often, penetration tests are performed for specific purposes: • As a
"dramatic" demonstration of an attack, usually to convince
decision-makers of their enterprise's weaknesses • As a means to test
the correct operation of enterprise defenses ("verification") • To test
that the enterprise has built the right defenses in the first place
("validation")

Independent penetration testing can provide valuable and objective
insights about the existence of vulnerabilities in enterprise assets and
humans, and the efficacy of defenses and mitigating controls to protect
against adverse impacts to the enterprise. They are part of a
comprehensive, ongoing program of security management and improvement.
They can also reveal process weaknesses, such as incomplete or
inconsistent configuration management, or end-user training.

Penetration testing differs from vulnerability testing, described in CIS
Control 7. Vulnerability testing just checks for presence of known,
insecure enterprise assets, and stops there. Penetration testing goes
further to exploit those weaknesses to see how far an attacker could
get, and what business process or data might be impacted through
exploitation of that vulnerability. This is an important detail, and
often penetration testing and vulnerability testing are incorrectly used
interchangeably. Vulnerability testing is exclusively automated scanning
with sometimes manual validation of false positives, whereas penetration
testing requires more human involvement and analysis, sometimes
supported through the use of custom tools or scripts. However,
vulnerability testing is often a starting point for a penetration test.

Another common term is "Red Team" exercises. These are similar to
penetration tests in that vulnerabilities are exploited; however, the
difference is the focus. Red Teams simulate specific attacker TTPs to
evaluate how an enterprise's environment would withstand an attack from
a specific adversary, or category of adversaries.
