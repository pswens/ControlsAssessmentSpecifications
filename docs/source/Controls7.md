# CIS Control 7: Continuous Vulnerability Management

Develop a plan to continuously assess and track vulnerabilities in all
enterprise assets within the enterprise's infrastructure in order to
remediate, and minimize the window of opportunity for attackers.
Monitor public and private industry sources for new threats and
vulnerability information.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

Cyber defenders are constantly being challenged by attackers who are
looking for vulnerabilities within their infrastructure to exploit and
gain access. Defenders must have timely threat information available to
them about software updates, patches, security advisories, threat
bulletins, etc., and they should regularly review their environment to
identify these vulnerabilities before the attackers do. Understanding
and managing vulnerabilities is a continuous activity, requiring focus
of time, attention, and resources.

Attackers have access to the same information and can often take
advantage of vulnerabilities more quickly than an enterprise can
remediate. While there is a gap in time from a vulnerability being known
to when it is patched, defenders can prioritize which vulnerabilities
are most impactful to the enterprise or likely to be exploited first
due to ease of use. For example, when researchers or the community
report new vulnerabilities, vendors have to develop and deploy patches,
indicators of compromise (IOCs), and updates. Defenders need to assess
the risk of the new vulnerability to the enterprise, regression-test
patches, and install the patch.

There is never perfection in this process. Attackers might be using an
exploit to a vulnerability that is not known within the security
community. They might have developed an exploit to this vulnerability,
referred to as a "zero-day" exploit. Once the vulnerability is known in
the community, the process mentioned above starts. Therefore, defenders
must keep in mind that an exploit might already exist when the
vulnerability is widely socialized. Sometimes vulnerabilities might be
known within a closed community (e.g., vendor still developing a fix)
for weeks, months, or years before it is disclosed publicly. Defenders
have to be aware that there might always be vulnerabilities they cannot
remediate and, therefore, need to use other controls to mitigate.

Enterprises that do not assess their infrastructure for vulnerabilities
and proactively address discovered flaws face a significant likelihood
of having their enterprise assets compromised. Defenders face particular
challenges in scaling remediation across an entire enterprise and
prioritizing actions with conflicting priorities while not impacting
the enterprise's business or mission.

## 7.1: Establish and Maintain a Vulnerability Management Process

Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

| Asset Type  | Security Function | Implementation Groups |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Applications | Protect           | 1, 2, 3               |

### Dependencies

- None

### Inputs

1. Enterprise vulnerability management process.
2. Date of the last update to the vulnerability management process.

### Operations

1. Determine whether the enterprise maintains a vulnerability management process:
   
    1. If the process exists, M1 = 1
    2. If the process does not exist, M1 = 0

2. Compare the date from Input 1 to the current date and enumerate the timeframe in months (M2)

### Measures

- M1 = Output of Operation 1.
- M2 = Timeframe since the last update to the vulnerability management process.

### Metrics

- If M1 is 0, this safeguard receives a failing score. The other metrics don't apply.
- If M2 is greater than twelve, this safeguard receives a failing score. The other metrics don't apply.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7.2: Establish and Maintain a Remediation Process

Establish and maintain a risk-based remediation strategy documented in a remediation process, with monthly or more frequent reviews.

| Asset Type  | Security Function | Implementation Groups |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Applications | Respond           | 1, 2, 3               |

### Dependencies

- None

### Inputs

1. Enterprise remediation strategy process.
2. Date of the last review of the process.
3. `GV18`: Enterprise assets storing, processing, and transmitting sensitive data.

### Operations

1. Determine whether the enterprise maintains a documented remediation process:
   
    1. If the process exists, M1 = 1
    2. If the process does not exist, M1 = 0

2. Check the documented remediation process to identify whether it includes a risk-based process based on the following elements: Sensitive assets `GV18` and criticality of vulnerability:
   
    1. Each element, if included, gets a value of 1. Sum all elements (M2)

3. Compare the date from Input 2 and the current date. Enumerate the timeframe in terms of days (M3)

### Measures

- M1 = Output of Operation 1.
- M2 = Sum of elements included in the remediation process.
- M3 = Timeframe since the last review of the process in days.

### Metrics

- If M1 is 0, the safeguard receives a failing score. The other metrics don't apply.
- If M3 is greater than thirty, the safeguard receives a failing score. The other metrics don't apply.
