title: "1.2: Address Unauthorized Assets"
---

Ensure that a process exists to address unauthorized assets on a weekly
basis. The enterprise may choose to remove the asset from the network,
deny the asset from connecting remotely to the network, or quarantine
the asset.

# Dependencies

-   Safeguard 1.1: Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset
    Inventory

# Inputs

1.  `GV1`: Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory
2.  `GV2`: Unauthorized Assets
3.  The enterprise defined time frame for removing unauthorized assets
    (weekly or more often).

## Assumptions

1.  If the item is not reachable, it may be reasonable to assume it has
    been removed from the network and therefore dealt with.

# Operations

If the optional disposition list is provided, the checks would be
tailored to those dispositions. For the following, assume no disposition
list is available:

1.  At the time frame specified by Input 3, for each unauthorized asset
    in `GV2`, check to see if the asset is present in the updated asset
    inventory from `GV1`.

2.  

    For those items in `GV2` that are not in `GV1`, scan the network to determine if the item is still reachable on the network.

    :   1.  Enumerate the items from `GV2` that are unreachable (M4)
        2.  Enumerate the items from `GV1` that are unreachable (M5)

# Measures

-   M1 = `GV1`
-   M2 = Count of `GV2`
-   M3 = Timeframe in days for Input 3
-   M4 = Count of items from `GV2` that are unreachable after scan
-   M5 = Count of items from `GV1` that are unreachable after scan

# Metrics

If M3 is greater than seven days, then this safeguard is measured at a 0
and receives a failing score. The other metrics don\'t apply.

## Coverage

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Metric**      | | The ratio of unaccounted for, unauthorized      |
|                 |   assets, to the total assets in the asset        |
|                 | | inventory.                                      |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Calculation** | | If the value of M4 is 0, there are no           |
|                 |   unauthorized assets that remain unaccounted     |
|                 |   for.                                            |
|                 | | In this case, the value of the metric is 1.     |
|                 |   Otherwise, the value is `(M2 - M4) / M2 `       |
