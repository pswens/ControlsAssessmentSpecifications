## 1.3: Utilize an Active Discovery Tool

Utilize an active discovery tool to identify assets connected to the
enterprise's network. Configure the active discovery tool to execute
daily, or more frequently.

Asset Type | Security Function | Implementation Groups
------------ | ------------- | ------------
Devices | Identify | 2, 3

### Dependencies

-   Safeguard 4.1: Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process

### Inputs

1.  `GV1`: Enterprise asset inventory
2.  The list of active discovery tool(s) used by the enterprise
3.  List consisting of the union from scan results conducted using all
    active asset discovery tool(s) within the enterprise (discovered
    assets).
4.  Timeframe between two active asset discovery tool scans.
5.  `GV3`: Configuration Standard

#### Assumptions

1.  The asset discovery tools on the provided list are active asset
    discovery tools, as opposed to passive asset discovery tools
    (verification of this is not performed during the following
    operations).

### Operations

1.  Identify enterprise assets not discovered by the active discovery
    tools by comparing Input 1 and Input 3 (M2).

2.  Identify the configurations for active asset discovery tools that
    interface with `GV1` by using `GV3`

3. Using the configuration information in `GV3`, check the approved configurations to verify that the tools are capable of interfacing with the asset inventory to make automatic updates.
   1. Enumerate those tools that are compliant (M3)
   2. Enumerate those that are not compliant (M4).


### Measures

-   M1 = Count of all discovered assets from Input 3
-   M2 = Count of undiscovered assets
-   M3 = Count of properly configured tools
-   M4 = Count of improperly configured tools
-   M5 = Count of Input 2
-   M6 = Count of `GV1`
-   M7 = Timeframe in hours for Input 4

### Metrics

-   If M7 is greater than 24 hours, then this safeguard is measured at a
    0 and receives a failing score. The other metrics don\'t apply.
-   If M5 is 0, then this safeguard is measured at a 0 and receives a
    failing score. The other metrics don\'t apply.

#### Asset Discovery Coverage

| Metric              | Asset Discovery Coverage                  |
|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------------:|
| Calculation         | `M1 / M6`                                 |


#### Tool Compliance Ratio

| Metric          | Tool Compliance Ratio |
|:---------------:|:---------------------:|
| Calculation     | `M3 / M2`             |
