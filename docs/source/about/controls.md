About the CIS Controls™
=======================

The CIS Controls™ are a prioritized set of actions that collectively form a defense-in-depth set
of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks. The
CIS Controls are developed by a community of IT experts who apply their first-hand experience
as cyber defenders to create these globally accepted security best practices. The experts who
develop the CIS Controls come from a wide range of sectors including retail, manufacturing,
healthcare, education, government, defense, and others.

We are at a fascinating point in the evolution of what we now call cyber defense. Massive data
losses, theft of intellectual property, credit card breaches, identity theft, threats to our privacy,
denial of service – these have become a way of life for all of us in cyberspace.

As defenders we have access to an extraordinary array of security tools and technology,
security standards, training and classes, certifications, vulnerability databases, guidance, best
practices, catalogs of security controls, and countless security checklists, benchmarks, and
recommendations. To help us understand the threat, we have seen the emergence of threat
information feeds, reports, tools, alert services, standards, and threat sharing frameworks. To top
it all off, we are surrounded by security requirements, risk management frameworks, compliance
regimes, regulatory mandates, and so forth. There is no shortage of information available to
security practitioners on what they should do to secure their infrastructure.

But all of this technology, information, and oversight has become a veritable “Fog of More” –
competing options, priorities, opinions, and claims that can paralyze or distract an enterprise
from vital action. Business complexity is growing, dependencies are expanding, users are
becoming more mobile, and the threats are evolving. New technology brings us great benefits,
but it also means that our data and applications are now distributed across multiple locations,
many of which are not within our organization’s infrastructure. In this complex, interconnected
world, no enterprise can think of its security as a standalone problem.

So how can we as a community – the community-at-large, as well as within industries, sectors,
partnerships, and coalitions – band together to establish priority of action, support each other,
and keep our knowledge and technology current in the face of a rapidly evolving problem and
an apparently infinite number of possible solutions? What are the most critical areas we need
to address and how should an enterprise take the first step to mature their risk management
program? Rather than chase every new exceptional threat and neglect the fundamentals, how
can we get on track with a roadmap of fundamentals, and guidance to measure and improve?
Which defensive steps have the greatest value?

These are the kinds of issues that led to and now drive the CIS Controls. They started as a grassroots
activity to cut through the “Fog of More” and focus on the most fundamental and valuable
actions that every enterprise should take. And **value** here is determined by knowledge and data –
the ability to prevent, alert, and respond to the attacks that are plaguing enterprises today.

Led by CIS®, the CIS Controls have been matured by an international community of individuals and
institutions that:

* Share insight into attacks and attackers, identify root causes, and translate that into classes of defensive action;
* Document stories of adoption and share tools to solve problems;
* Track the evolution of threats, the capabilities of adversaries, and current vectors of intrusions;
* Map the CIS Controls to regulatory and compliance frameworks and bring collective priority and focus to them;
* Share tools, working aids, and translations; and
* Identify common problems (like initial assessment and implementation roadmaps) and solve them as a community.

These activities ensure that the CIS Controls are not just another list of good things to do, but
a prioritized, highly focused set of actions that have a community support network to make
them implementable, usable, scalable, and compliant with all industry or government security
requirements.

Why the CIS Controls Work: Methodology and Contributors
-------------------------------------------------------

The CIS Controls are informed by actual attacks and effective defenses and reflect the combined
knowledge of experts from every part of the ecosystem (companies, governments, individuals);
with every role (threat responders and analysts, technologists, vulnerability-finders, tool makers,
solution providers, defenders, users, policy-makers, auditors, etc.); and within many sectors
(government, power, defense, finance, transportation, academia, consulting, security, IT) who
have banded together to create, adopt, and support the Controls.
Top experts from organizations pooled their extensive first-hand
knowledge from defending against actual cyber-attacks to evolve the
consensus list of Controls, representing the best defensive techniques
to prevent or track them. This ensures that the CIS Controls are the
most effective and specific set of technical measures available to detect,
prevent, respond, and mitigate damage from the most common to the
most advanced of those attacks.

The CIS Controls are not limited to blocking the initial compromise of
systems, but also address detecting already-compromised machines
and preventing or disrupting attackers’ follow-on actions. The defenses
identified through these Controls deal with reducing the initial attack
surface by hardening device configurations, identifying compromised
machines to address long-term threats inside an organization’s
network, disrupting attackers’ command-and-control of implanted
malicious code, and establishing an adaptive, continuous defense, and
response capability that can be maintained and improved.

The five critical tenets of an effective cyber defense system as reflected
in the CIS Controls are:

**Offense informs defense**: Use knowledge of actual attacks that have
compromised systems to provide the foundation to continually learn
from these events to build effective, practical defenses. Include only
those controls that can be shown to stop known real-world attacks.

**Prioritization**: Invest first in Controls that will provide the greatest risk
reduction and protection against the most dangerous threat actors
and that can be feasibly implemented in your computing environment.
The CIS Implementation Groups discussed below are a great place for
organizations to start identifying relevant Sub-Controls.

**Measurements and Metrics**: Establish common metrics to provide a
shared language for executives, IT specialists, auditors, and security
officials to measure the effectiveness of security measures within
an organization so that required adjustments can be identified and
implemented quickly.

**Continuous diagnostics and mitigation**: Carry out continuous
measurement to test and validate the effectiveness of current security
measures and to help drive the priority of next steps.

**Automation**: Automate defenses so that organizations can achieve
reliable, scalable, and continuous measurements of their adherence to
the Controls and related metrics.

Getting Started
------------------------

The CIS Controls are a relatively small number of prioritized, well-vetted, and supported security
actions that organizations can take to assess and improve their current security state. They also
change the discussion from “What should my enterprise do?” to “What should we ALL be doing?”
to improve security across a broad scale.

But this is not a one-size-fits-all solution, in either content or priority. You must still understand
what is critical to your business, data, systems, networks, and infrastructures, and you must
consider the adversarial actions that could impact your ability to be successful in the business or
operation. Even a relatively small number of Controls cannot be executed all at once, so you will
need to develop a plan for assessment, implementation, and process management.
