CIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets
=======================================================

Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all enterprise assets
(end-user devices, including portable and mobile; network devices;
non-computing/Internet of Things (IoT) devices; and servers) connected
to the infrastructure, physically, virtually, remotely, and those within
cloud environments, to accurately know the totality of assets that need
to be monitored and protected within the enterprise. This will also
support identifying unauthorized and unmanaged assets to remove or
remediate.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

Enterprises cannot defend what they do not know they have. Managed
control of all enterprise assets also plays a critical role in security
monitoring, incident response, system backup, and recovery. Enterprises
should know what data is critical to them, and proper asset management
will help identify those enterprise assets that hold or manage this
critical data, so appropriate security controls can be applied.

External attackers are continuously scanning the internet address space
of target enterprises, premise-based or in the cloud, identifying
possibly unprotected assets attached to enterprises\' networks.
Attackers can take advantage of new assets that are installed, yet not
securely configured and patched. Internally, unidentified assets can
also have weak security configurations that can make them vulnerable to
web or email-based malware; and adversaries can leverage weak security
configurations for traversing the network, once they are inside.

Additional assets that connect to the enterprise's network (e.g.,
demonstration systems, temporary test systems, guest networks, etc.)
should be identified and/or isolated, in order to prevent adversarial
access from affecting the security of enterprise operations.

Large, complex, dynamic enterprises understandably struggle with the
challenge of managing intricate, fast-changing environments. However,
attackers have shown the ability, patience, and willingness to
"inventory and control" our enterprise assets at very large scale in
order to support their opportunities.

Another challenge is that portable end-user devices will periodically
join a network and then disappear, making the inventory of currently
available assets very dynamic. Likewise, cloud environments and virtual
machines can be difficult to track in asset inventories when they are
shut down or paused. Another benefit of complete enterprise asset
management is supporting incident response. Both when investigating the
origination of network traffic from an asset on the network, and to be
able to identify all potentially vulnerable, or impacted, assets of
similar type or location during an incident.
