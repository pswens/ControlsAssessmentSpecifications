# CIS Control 3: Data Protection

Develop processes and technical controls to identify, classify, securely
handle, retain, and dispose of data.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

Data is no longer only contained within an enterprise's border, it is in
the cloud, on portable end-user devices where users work from home, and
is often shared with partners or online services who might have it
anywhere in the world. In addition to sensitive data an enterprise holds
related to finances, intellectual property, and customer data, there
also might be numerous international regulations for the protection of
personal data. Data privacy has become increasingly important, and
enterprises are learning that privacy is about the appropriate use and
management of data, not just encryption. Data must be appropriately
managed through its entire lifecycle. These privacy rules can be
complicated for multi-national enterprises of any size. However, there
are fundamentals that can apply to all.

Once attackers have penetrated an enterprise's infrastructure, one of
their first tasks is to find and exfiltrate data. Enterprises might not
be aware that sensitive data is leaving their environment because they
are not monitoring data outflows.

While many attacks occur on the network, others involve physical theft
of portable end-user devices, attacks on service providers, or other
partners holding sensitive data. Other sensitive enterprise assets may
also include non-computing devices that provide management and control
of physical systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) systems.

The enterprise's loss of control over protected or sensitive data is a
serious and often reportable business impact. While some data is
compromised or lost as a result of theft or espionage, the vast majority
are a result of poorly understood data management rules and user error.
The adoption of data encryption, both in transit and at rest, can
provide mitigation against data compromise and, more importantly, is a
regulatory requirement for most controlled data.

## 3.1: Establish and Maintain a Data Management Process

Establish and maintain a data management process. In the process, address data sensitivity, data owner, handling of data, data retention limits, and disposal requirements based on sensitivity and retention standards for the enterprise. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur, that could impact this Safeguard.

## 3.12: Segment Data Processing and Storage Based on Sensitivity

Segment data processing and storage
based on the sensitivity of the data. Do not process sensitive data on
enterprise assets intended for lower sensitivity data.

| Asset Type   | Security Function | Implementation Groups |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Network | Protect          | 2, 3                |

### Dependencies

-   Safeguard 3.2: Establish and Maintain a Data Inventory
-   Safeguard 12.4: Establish and Maintain Architecture Diagram(s)

### Inputs

1.  `GV12`: Sensitive Data Inventory
2.  `GV4`: Enterprise Network Architecture Documentation

### Assumptions 

1. An asset's overall sensitivity level should be the highest sensitivity level of the data it stores/processes/transmits. If a system contains any sensitive information, that asset should be treated accordingly and should be properly separated from networks or network segments that don't have a need to access that type of sensitive information.

### Operations

1.  For each item in `GV12` identify the assets that store, process, or
    transmit sensitive data (:code:\`GV18: M1)

2. Use the output of Operation 1 and `GV4` to identify networks/VLANs connected to the assets:

    1. Identify and enumerate any instances of properly separated assets from less sensitive networks (M2)
    2. Identify and enumerate any instances of improperly separated assets from less sensitive networks (M3)

### Measures

-   M1 = Count of assets storing, processing, or transmitting sensitive
    data
-   M2 = Count of sensitive assets properly separated from less
    sensitive networks
-   M3 = Count of sensitive assets improperly separated from less
    sensitive networks

### Metrics

#### Coverage

| **Metric**      | The percentage of properly separated sensitive assets.                   |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calculation** | `M2 / M1`                                                            |

## 3.13: Deploy a Data Loss Prevention Solution

Implement an automated tool, such as a host-based Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tool, to identify all sensitive data stored, processed, or transmitted through enterprise assets, including those located onsite or at a remote service provider, and update the enterprise's sensitive data inventory.

| Asset Type | Security Function | Implementation Groups |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Data       | Protect           | 3                     |

### Dependencies

- Safeguard 2.1: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory
- Safeguard 3.2: Establish and Maintain a Data Inventory

### Inputs

1. `GV18`: Enterprise assets storing, processing, or transmitting sensitive data
2. `GV5`: Authorized Software inventory
3. `GV3`: Configuration Standards

### Operations

1. Use `GV5` to identify and enumerate all data loss prevention software
2. Compare `GV18` and the output of Operation 1
   1. Identify and enumerate each asset in `GV18` with data loss prevention software installed (M2)
   2. Identify and enumerate each asset in `GV18` without data loss prevention software installed (M3)
3. For assets with data loss prevention installed from Operation 2.1, check `GV3` for configuration information
   1. Identify and enumerate assets with properly configured data loss prevention software (M4)
   2. Identify and enumerate assets with improperly configured data loss prevention software (M5)

### Measures

- M1 = Count of `GV18`
- M2 = Count of assets with data loss prevention software
- M3 = Count of assets without data loss prevention software
- M4 = Count of assets with properly configured data loss prevention software
- M5 = Count of assets with improperly configured data loss prevention software

### Metrics

#### Coverage

| Metric          | The percentage of assets covered by at least one properly configured data loss prevention software instance. |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calculation     | `M4 / M1`                                                                                                   |

## 3.14: Log Sensitive Data Access

Log sensitive data access, including modification and disposal.

2. `GV19`: Enterprise assets storing sensitive data
3. `GV3`: Configuration Standards

### Operations

1. Using `GV3` identify authorized logging software
2. For each asset in `GV19`, use the output from Operation 1
   1. Identify and enumerate assets with logging software installed (M2)
   2. Identify and enumerate assets that do not have logging software installed (M3)
3. For logging software installed, check configuration using `GV3`
   1. Identify and enumerate software that is properly configured (M4)
   2. Identify and enumerate software that is improperly configured (M5)

### Measures

- M1 = Count of `GV19`
- M2 = Count of assets storing sensitive data with logging software
